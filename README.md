#  Template Engine - Employee Summary


## Description

An engineering team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.


```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```


How do this app work? 

* This app runs as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee.

* node app.js         // Runs the application

* Prompt the user for their:
  * -> role,
  * -> name,
  * -> email, 
  * -> id, 
  * And specific information based on their role with the company. 
  * -> an intern provide their school. 
  * -> whereas an engineer provide their GitHub username.



### Below is an example of what the application looks like.
